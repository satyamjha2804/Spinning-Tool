# Spinning-Tool
The "Spinning Wheel of Fortune" project is an interactive web application that simulates a classic spinning wheel game. Users can click on a spin button to initiate the spinning animation, and the wheel will randomly stop at one of several colorful segments. Each segment represents a different color along with its associated meaning.
